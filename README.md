## Installation/Preparation
Run `./install.sh` to get the ghci compiler ready.
This takes around 5 minutes to complete on first run, from then on it takes no time at all to run.

- Answer [P] or [Y] to any questions it asks you (yes).
- If it looks like it's not doing anything, you may need to press ENTER to proceed.
- Once it's finished, you'll see a smiley face and a lot of green text.

## Using Haskell
To access the console, enter ghci

To run a file, enter `ghci filename.hs`

To exit the console, enter `CTRL+D`

You may want to create a `.hs` file to store your functions in.
